Everything the \nCouncil does contributes to making Islington fairer, creating a place where everyone, \nwhatever their background, has the same opportunity to reach their potential and \nenjoy a good quality of life. The Local Plan is integral to achieving these aims. It sets \nout a range of planning policies to steer development in the borough over the next \nfifteen years \u2013 this includes: \n\u2022 spatial policies covering specific areas in the borough; \n\u2022 strategic policies which outline the key priorities across a number of policy areas; \n\u2022 detailed criteria-based policies, which stem from strategic requirements and are \nthe main basis on which planning decisions are made; and \n\u2022 specific site allocations which provide fine-grain detail on a number of planned \nand potential development sites across Islington. \n1.2 \nThe Local Plan provides a clear, bold framework for planning decisions which set out \nwhat we expect", "e fine-grain detail on a number of planned \nand potential development sites across Islington. \n1.2 \nThe Local Plan provides a clear, bold framework for planning decisions which set out \nwhat we expect from development. The Local Plan covers the period 2020/21 to \n2036/37 (\u201cthe plan period\u201d). Islington is a borough with significant constraints, and it is \nnot hyperbole to state that each and every development must make the most of every \nsite and development opportunity, in order to ensure that opportunities for using \nincreasingly scarce resources, including a lack of developable land, are not wasted. \n1.3 \nWe can only succeed by working with key public and private sector partners such as \nthe police, health service, and local universities as well as with local communities. The \nLocal Plan has been prepared in co-operation with these stakeholders and many \nothers, including adjacent boroughs in line with the Duty to Co-operate. This \nco-operation does not stop once the Local Plan is ad", " has been prepared in co-operation with these stakeholders and many \nothers, including adjacent boroughs in line with the Duty to Co-operate. This \nco-operation does not stop once the Local Plan is adopted; it is a continuous process, \nwhich enables policies to remain effective throughout the lifetime of the plan. \n1.4 \nThe Local Plan is informed by an extensive evidence base, both technical and \nnon-technical. In preparing the document, this evidence has provided the basis \nfor our approach. Policy requirements at the national and regional level also have \ndirect implications on what the Council can and cannot do. Where possible, we have \nsought to reflect the full range of opinion \u2013 from stakeholders, evidence and policy \nrequirements \u2013 but it is never possible to identify a single approach with which \neveryone will agree and which would be found \u2018sound\u2019 and compliant with various \nstatutory requirements set out in planning legislation. \nThe planning framework \n1.5 \nThe Local Plan is", "ach with which \neveryone will agree and which would be found \u2018sound\u2019 and compliant with various \nstatutory requirements set out in planning legislation. \nThe planning framework \n1.5 \nThe Local Plan is developed within a complex planning framework, at the heart of \nwhich is primary legislation which sets out the basic legal parameters within which the \nLocal Plan should be prepared and subsequently operate. The Planning and \nCompulsory Purchase Act 2004 (\u201cThe PCPA\u201d) provides the fundamental basis on \nwhich the plan-led system functions. It sets out the definition of Local Development \n8 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDocuments, a suite of documents which must (taken as a whole) set out the authority\u2019s \npolicies (however expressed) relating to the development and use of land in their area. \nThis includes documents which have Development Plan status as well as those which \ndo not, such as Supplementary Pla", "ies (however expressed) relating to the development and use of land in their area. \nThis includes documents which have Development Plan status as well as those which \ndo not, such as Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) and the Statement of \nCommunity Involvement (SCI). \n1.6 \nThe Development Plan is the key set of documents which inform decisions on planning \napplications. In Islington, the Development Plan consists of any locally adopted \nDevelopment Plan Documents (such as the Local Plan) and the London Plan (the \nSpatial Development Strategy prepared by the Mayor of London). Any \u2018made\u2019 \nneighbourhood plans \u2013 those which have been successful at examination and \nreferendum \u2013 also form part of the Development Plan. \n1.7 \nThe PCPA specifies that planning applications must be made in accordance with the \nDevelopment Plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. What does and \ndoes not constitute a material consideration is determined on a case-by-case basis, as \nis the weigh", "rdance with the \nDevelopment Plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. What does and \ndoes not constitute a material consideration is determined on a case-by-case basis, as \nis the weight to be given to any such considerations. \n1.8 \nSecondary legislation provides further detail on the operation of primary legislation. \nThe Town and Country Planning (Local Planning) (England) Regulations 2012 (as \namended) sets out the process for preparing and adopting a Local Plan. It also \nrequires Local Planning Authorities (LPAs) to review Local Development Documents \u2013 \nsuch as the Local Plan \u2013 every five years from the date of adoption. A review does not \nmean that policies will definitely need to change \u2013 it merely requires an objective \nassessment of policies to determine whether they need updating. Where the review \nconcludes that updates are not necessary, the LPAs must publish the reasons why. \n1.9 \nThe National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) sets out the Government\u2019s plannin", " need updating. Where the review \nconcludes that updates are not necessary, the LPAs must publish the reasons why. \n1.9 \nThe National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) sets out the Government\u2019s planning \npolicies for England and how they should be applied. It provides a framework within \nwhich locally-prepared plans addressing housing needs and other economic, social \nand environmental priorities can be produced. The NPPF must be taken into account \nin preparing the development plan; it is also a material consideration in planning \ndecisions, although the weight attributed to the NPPF will depend on the details of \neach application. Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) provides further detail on policies \nin the NPPF. \n1.10 \nThe London Plan is the Spatial Development Strategy for Greater London. It is a \nstrategic plan for London which sets out a policy framework covering a variety of \neconomic, social and environmental issues. It is part of the Development Plan, \nmeaning it must be taken i", ". It is a \nstrategic plan for London which sets out a policy framework covering a variety of \neconomic, social and environmental issues. It is part of the Development Plan, \nmeaning it must be taken into account in the determination of planning applications. \nFor plan-making, the London Plan provides the strategic, London-wide policy context \nfor all borough Local Development Documents; all such documents including the Local \nPlan have to be \u2018in general conformity\u2019 with the London Plan. \n1.11 \nThis iteration of Islington\u2019s Local Plan is made up of four Development Plan Documents: \n\u2022 Local Plan: Strategic and Development Management policies \u2013 the principal \ndocument in the Local Plan, which sets out strategic policies to identify where and \nhow change will happen in Islington; and detailed policies to manage development. \n\u2022 Site Allocations \u2013 this document sets out site specific policy for a number of sites \nacross the borough which will contribute to meeting development needs. \n\u2022 Bunhi", "policies to manage development. \n\u2022 Site Allocations \u2013 this document sets out site specific policy for a number of sites \nacross the borough which will contribute to meeting development needs. \n\u2022 Bunhill and Clerkenwell Area Action Plan (AAP) \u2013 a plan for the south of the \nborough where significant change is expected to occur. The plan sets out spatial \npolicies covering different parts of the area with further policies to manage \ndevelopment. \n9 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u2022 North London Waste Plan \u2013 a joint waste plan together with six other boroughs \nwithin the North London Waste Authority area (Camden, Haringey, Hackney, \nBarnet, Enfield and Waltham Forest). The Waste Plan identifies a range of suitable \nsites for the management of all North London\u2019s waste and includes policies and \nguidelines for determining planning applications for waste developments. \n1.12 \nThere are a number of SPDs which provide further guidance on Local Plan policies. \nThe Policies Map visualises", "cies and \nguidelines for determining planning applications for waste developments. \n1.12 \nThere are a number of SPDs which provide further guidance on Local Plan policies. \nThe Policies Map visualises the various designations identified in the Local Plan. \nImplementation of the Local Plan will be monitored through the Authorities \nMonitoring Report. \nFigure 1.1: Islington Planning Framework \nStrategic and non-strategic policies \n1.13 \nSection 19 (1B-E) of the PCPA requires LPAs to identify the strategic priorities for the \ndevelopment and use of land in the authority\u2019s area1. Policies to address those \npriorities must be set out in the LPAs development plan documents (taken as a whole). \nThe NPPF elaborates on the legislative requirement, making clear that Local Plans \nshould identify strategic policies, clearly distinguishing from other policies which are \nconsidered non-strategic. \n1 As noted in paragraph 1.10, the London Plan forms part of Islington\u2019s Development Plan. Where \nLPAs a", "tegic policies, clearly distinguishing from other policies which are \nconsidered non-strategic. \n1 As noted in paragraph 1.10, the London Plan forms part of Islington\u2019s Development Plan. Where \nLPAs are satisfied that policies to address the area\u2019s strategic priorities are set out in the London \nPlan, policies to address these priorities do not need to be set out in local DPDs. For avoidance of \ndoubt, the Local Plan is considered to set out the full suite of policies to address Islington\u2019s strategic \npriorities. Some DPD policies do refer to relevant London Plan policies but none of the strategic \npriorities of the plan is entirely reliant on the London Plan. \n10 \nFigure 1.1: Islington Planning Framework \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.14 \nStrategic policies should set out an overall strategy for the pattern, scale and quality of \ndevelopment including housing and employment uses.

It is both a gateway to the commercial \nheart of the city and to the suburbs, and the varied character of the borough reflects this. \nFigure 1.2: Islington in context \n1.17 \nIslington as a place is both small and incredibly diverse.

Fundamental to almost all of \nthem is the degree of contrast within an area which contains both some of the \ncountry\u2019s most deprived neighbourhoods in close proximity to areas of very \nconsiderable wealth; the borough registers as the thirteenth most deprived in the \ncountry.

In terms of Islington residents, over 70% work in Islington, the City of London, \nWestminster or Camden. Islington has a low proportion of car-owning households but \nsuffers from a number of heavily trafficked through-routes, particularly the A1 (Goswell \nRoad, Upper Street, Holloway Road) and A503 (York Way, Caledonian Road and \nPentonville Road/City Road). \n1.22 \nIslington is an important employment centre, evidenced by the significant posit", "Goswell \nRoad, Upper Street, Holloway Road) and A503 (York Way, Caledonian Road and \nPentonville Road/City Road). \n1.22 \nIslington is an important employment centre, evidenced by the significant positive net \ninflow of employees, the fourth highest of all Inner London boroughs. As \nmanufacturing has shrunk dramatically over recent years, office-based businesses \nincluding financial and business services and, more recently, technology and creative \nindustries, have all grown rapidly, mirroring the structural shift towards a service-based \neconomy seen across the UK. At present, employment sectors are diverse although \nmost employment space and jobs are concentrated in the south of the borough. \n1.23 \nThe borough is a popular place to live and visit and is valued for its built environment. \nIslington\u2019s mix of shopping, restaurants, culture and night-time economy, rich \narchitecture and walkable environment draws visitors wishing to explore beyond the \nstandard tourist attractions of cent", "Islington\u2019s mix of shopping, restaurants, culture and night-time economy, rich \narchitecture and walkable environment draws visitors wishing to explore beyond the \nstandard tourist attractions of central London. \n1.24 \nIslington comprised a number of villages before it became a suburb of Victorian \nLondon and continues to have its own character.

This is in part due to the character of the \nborough, shortage of developable land and the historic pattern of development. The \ndevelopment strategy advocated in recent years, by the Mayor of London and by \nGovernment, was to focus new development in Inner London, on brownfield sites. \n14 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIslington has made a significant contribution to delivery of new housing and \nemployment space over the past two decades, in line with this overarching \ndevelopment strategy; our small size has not prevented the borough taking a bold and \nexpansive approach to new development.

These objectives are not \ndrafted to sit idle in the Local Plan introduction; they must be actively considered from \nthe very first stage of a development proposal.
